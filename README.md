# Sberbank-
Housing costs demand a significant investment from both consumers and developers. Sberbank, Russiaâ€™s oldest and largest bank, helps their customers by making predictions about realty prices so renters, developers, and lenders are more confident when they sign a lease or purchase a building.
In this project, we will develop regression algorithms which use a broad spectrum of features to predict realty prices. We will rely on a rich dataset that includes housing data and macroeconomic patterns.
